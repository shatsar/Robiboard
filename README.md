My wife wanted a private, visual, web-based bookmarking tool with nested categories.

A sort of Pinterest with unlimited, nested private boards.

Here it is:

- Homepage with endless scrolling with every bookmark you added


- Add a new bookmark with local image or a remote url


- Add nested categories



== Run
It is a rails 3 app, so you can clone it, bundle install and rails server
